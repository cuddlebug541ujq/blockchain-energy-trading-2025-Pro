## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that sits at the intersection of decentralized energy markets and the mature world of centralized crypto finance.

Here‚Äôs a detailed description of how blockchain-based energy trading integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Core Concept: Two Layers of Interaction

First, it's crucial to understand that this integration operates on two distinct but connected layers:

1.  **The Decentralized Energy Layer:** This is where the physical energy (kWh) is tokenized and traded peer-to-peer on a specialized energy blockchain (e.g., Energy Web Chain, Power Ledger).
2.  **The Centralized Finance (CeFi) Layer:** This is where the proceeds from energy sales (now in the form of a stablecoin or other crypto) are managed for investment, hedging, and growth on exchanges like Binance and Kraken.

The integration is the bridge that allows value and data to flow automatically between these two layers.
